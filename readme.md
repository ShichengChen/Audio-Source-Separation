# WaveNet
## WaveNet structure
![wavenet structure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t7qkv.png "wavenet structure")
- Encode **audio** by [mu-law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm) and then quantize it to 256 possible values
- **Input** is a quantized audio array, for example, input.shape = L. L is the length of the audio.
- Causal Conv is a norm convolutional layer
![wavenet structure](http://benanne.github.io/images/wavenet.png "wavenet structure")
- Dilated Conv is shown as above figure.
- Left yellow circle is a tanh fuction and right yellow circle is sigmoid
- Red circle denotes an element-wise multiplication operator  Tanh(DilatedConv0(x)) * sigmoid(DilatedConv1(x))
- Green square are two norm convolutional layers with 1 * 1 kernel size
- One convolutional layer's output is followed by the residual summation, and the other convolutional layer's output is skip connections
- K is the layer
- Each block has a skip connection, red circle sums these skip connections up
- And then relu function, 1 * 1 kernel conv layer, relu, 1 * 1 conv layer and a softmax
- **Output** is quantized audio array, for example, output shape is 256 * L. 256 is 256 possible quantized values and L is the length of the audio.
- Map output to [-1,1] and then decode it to raw audio array.

## WaveNet for Audio Source Separation
- A is mix audio, B is vocals and C is accompaniment.
- The deepmind wavenet's input and label are only A
- I use A as input and B as label
![wavenet structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soobinseo/wavenet/master/png/wavenet.png)
- As shown in above figure, I slightly changed the dilated conv layers
- I use A[0:100] to predict B[50] instead of using A[0:50] to predict A[50]

# A Universal Music Translation Network
## facebook net structure
![facebook net structure](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EJWLapPO2Y88u3AYwstvmQ.png)
![facebook net structure](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*y2FfJ_LZub3oidZ19VVDow.png)
- The encoder is a fully convolutional network
- The encode part has three blocks of 10 residual-layers as shwon in the first above figure.
- the NC Dilated Conv layer is Dilated Conv layer
- After the three blocks, there is an additional 1 * 1 layer
- An average pooling with a kernel size of 800(if sample size for one second is 16000) follows
- And then [domain confusion loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07818.pdf), I re-implemented a domain confusion in [there](https://github.com/ShichengChen/Domain-Adversarial-Training-of-Neural-Networks).
- Upsampled to the original audio rate using nearest neighbor interpolation
![wavenet structure](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/37b5bb84ef02a8183b21ca697842693dbfc8b077/68747470733a2f2f64726976652e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f75633f6578706f72743d766965772669643d315a6f2d6335567a504c5345516c445f53794e6f6c793358575330413766693573)
- The above figure is new version wavenet
- The encoding audio is used to condition a WaveNet decoder. The conditioning signal is passed through a 1 Ã— 1 layer that is different for each WaveNet layer
- The WaveNet decoder has 4 blocks of 10 residual-layers
- The **input** and **output** are quantized using 8-bit mu-law encoding
- Loss fuction is softmax

## Data Augmentation for FacebookNet
- Uniformly select a segment of length between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds
- Modulate its pitch by a random number between -0.5 and 0.5 of half-steps

## Facebook Net for Audio Source Separation
- **Structure A**, I made the decoding part to be same as encoding, removed downsample and upsample, removed confusion loss.  
- I used data augmentation strategy from u-wave-net paper. For example, A is mix audio, B is vocals and C is accompaniment. B * factor0 + C * factor1 = newA, I used newA as input and C*factor1 as label. Factor0 and factor1 is chosen uniformly from the interval [0.7, 1.0].
- I used Ccmixter as dataset. Ccmixter has 3 Children's songs, two songs as training data and the other as testing data, the result on testing data is also very good even though is slightly worse than training data.
- Three rap songs can also generalize well.
- Two songs have different background music and same lyrics(two same voice), generalization is also ok, but worse than above two situations
- First 45 songs for training and last 5 songs for testing, the results is still not good.
- If I chose 9 different types of music, even in training set, the result is not good. I am trying to solve this problem. 

#### Some other tests
- Add downsample and upsample, add confusion loss, use short time fourier transform to preprocess the raw audio. The results are worse than **structure A**.

#### Domain confusion loss
- I implemented a domain confusion loss in [there](https://github.com/ShichengChen/Domain-Adversarial-Training-of-Neural-Networks).
- My result is better than original paper's result, but when I add to **structure A**, the result became very bad. Because I think that I need the domain information when I generate the music without voice. I should keep the original music and accompaniment having same type.

#### TODO for facebook net
 - Try to add decoding part to structure A. The bottleneck during inference is the
autoregressive process done by the WaveNet, try to use dedicated CUDA kernels [code](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-wavenet/tree/master/pytorch) by
NVIDIA

# [U-Wave-Net](https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net)
## U-Wave-Net Structure
![uwavenet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/master/waveunet.png)
- Use LeakyReLU activation except for the final one, which uses tanh
- Downsampling discards features for every other time step to halve the time resolution
- Concat concatenates the current high-level features with more local features x
- Since they do not padding zeros and so they need to crop for concatenating.
- **Input** and **output** are raw audio.
- Loss function is mean squared error

## Data Augmentation for U-Wave-Net
- A is mix audio, B is vocals and C is accompaniment. 
- B * factor0 + C * factor1 = newA
- A as input and C*factor1 as label
- Factor0 and factor1 is chosen uniformly from the interval [0.7, 1.0].

## Result for the [UWaveNet](https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net)
- The result is better than mine results
